TO DO - all questions for Anya now :)

- home page layout - get rid of big gap, few bigger photos? 
- embed videos + bandcamp albums to home page - potentially another "module" or 2 for "videos / releases"
- embed videos to sub-pages - white-reznichenko / solo
- photo credits - how to add these? legal requirement!

NICE TO HAVE
- pages - remove date + reading time
- alinas image as background - is this possible and is it a good idea? she is now skeptical :) the idea would be for it to be a loooong image to scroll through, like the examples underneath
- font & colour
- images loading quicker - should i just resize/compress them?


&&& got any other feedback? :D
