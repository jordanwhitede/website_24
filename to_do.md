TO DO - all questions for Anya now :)

1. photo credits - how to add these? legal requirement! also maybe click on photo and it gets bigger?
2. embed videos + bandcamp albums to home page - potentially another "module" or 2 for "videos / releases". See at linked examples.

NICE TO HAVE
- alinas image as background - is this possible and is it a good idea? she is now skeptical :) the idea would be for it to be a loooong image to scroll through, like the examples underneath
- font & colour
- images loading quicker - should i just resize/compress them?


&&& got any other feedback? :D
