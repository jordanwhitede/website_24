      <description>White-Reznichenko Quintet Friends since 2016, survivors of a jammed elevator door in 2019, Olga and Jordan started the White-Reznichenko Quintet in 2022. Inviting three stars of the german jazz scene in Peter Ehwald, Jonas Westergaard and John Schr√∂der, Olga and Jordan hope to shamelessly profit from the musicality and experience of their older, wiser colleagues. Five strongly contrasting personalities combine to create equally contrasting music.&#xA;Jordan White - Guitar, Composition</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m active in solo contexts both as a guitarist and an electronic performer - ideally, combining both. I&amp;rsquo;m currently working on a solo album, to be released around October, in which guitar improvisations are processed and manipulated exclusively using effects I&amp;rsquo;ve written myself in SuperCollider (and, slowly, C++). Here&amp;rsquo;s also a link to my previous solo release.</description>
