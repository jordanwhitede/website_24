I'm active in solo contexts both as a guitarist and an electronic performer - ideally, combining both. I'm currently working on a solo album, to be released around October, in which guitar improvisations are processed and manipulated exclusively using effects I've written myself in SuperCollider (and, slowly, C++). Here's also a link to my previous solo release.
